# Office Hours with Arbitrage

This office hours series is hosted by [long-time Numerai participant](https://numer.ai/arbitrage) Jon R. Taylor, a PhD Candidate in Business Administration and Finance at FAU. With five years of experience participating in Numerai's tournaments, Jon decided to share what he's learned with the community and create a video space where other participants can learn, share, and get to know one another.

These videos include interviews with Numerai participants, top tips and tricks for participating in Numerai, presentations and more. Jon R. Taylor also makes a point to highlight Numerai tournament updates, new features and releases as close to the new release as possible, and brings on members of the Numerai team when available to bring foward community questions. There are also Special Features, which tend to hone in on specific technical matters such as Feature Neutralization.

While the videos are available at Numerai's official YouTube channel, Numerai neither hosts nor directly moderates these conversations. We include these videos here and on YouTube as we believe they are helpful for knowledge-share among Numerai community members.
