# Models

There are plenty of tutorial models available from Numerai and its community:

* Numerai's basic example model can be found [on Github](https://github.com/numerai/signals-example-scripts).
* [Jason Rosenfeld](https://twitter.com/jrosenfeld13) ([jrAI](https://signals.numer.ai/jrai)) created an end-to-end notebook for Numerai Signals. It uses free data from Yahoo Finance to craft a dataset and train a simple model. You can find it on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ECh69C0LDCUnuyvEmNFZ51l\_276nkQqo) and watch [this video](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ECh69C0LDCUnuyvEmNFZ51l\_276nkQqo) about it.
* [Surajp](https://twitter.com/parmarsuraj99), inspired by the example and notebook above, wrote [this article](https://parmarsuraj99.medium.com/lets-talk-about-signals-841934f24450) about Signals.
* You can find a list of data sources [on the forum](https://forum.numer.ai/t/free-or-cheap-data-and-tools-for-numerai-signals/350).
